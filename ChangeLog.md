Terminal change log
===================

## ?.?.? / ????-??-??

* Added method to return terminal size as [colums, lines] tuple
  (@thekid)
* Added methods to clear terminal, position cursor and write text at
  given coordinates
  (@thekid)
* Allowed end tags to be spelled-out. The suggested usage is to write
  `<tag>`...`</>`, but `<tag>`...`</tag>` is fine now, too. This can
  be benefitial when editors have in-string autocompletion. Correct
  nesting is *not* verified!
